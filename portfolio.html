        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>My name is Elvis Marube.I am a student at Egerton University pursuing Computer Science.<br> I am a student from Kenya Nakuru county.
            I studied high school back in Nakuru High School <br>. Before Last year I wanted to a Pilot but soon after completing I never got a 
            chance to apply <br>in Piloting so I wondered what what next? So I decided the only opportunity I had to pursue was Technology. I was
            then passionate from technology since then especially <br>in the part of web development,data science and database. Since then I have been
            practicing coding and small projects almost weekly.
